Documents are data persisted within an off chain storage network and given a content identifier, which represents the document in the network, not kept on the `blockchain`. When uploading a document for storage, there must be validation against a [schema](/docs/intro/modules/schemas.mdx) in order to match in both property name, and type.

## Defining Documents

Objects are represented as `JSON`. Which makes it simple to define documents quickly. Support for JSON is found within most modern IDE and Code editors. However, depending on the [motor-sdk](/docs/guides/setup.mdx) target you are using, there will be different ways of representing document data.

### Example of an Document definition

In this section we will define an example scenario with a comment on a social media post. Below is the [schema](/docs/intro/modules/schemas.mdx) for our social media comment.

```json
{
  "from": {
    "kind": "STRING"
  },
  "payload": {
    "kind": "STRING"
  },
  "timestamp": {
    "kind": "INT"
  },
  "to": {
    "kind": "LIST",
    "list_kind:": {
      "kind": "STRING"
    }
  },
  "active": {
    "kind": "BOOL"
  }
}
```

Above we can see the following:

- `from` contains an example `Address` which is an account which made this comment.
- `payload` contains the actual data of the comment.
- `timestamp` contains the time (in unix epoch format) the comment was made.
- `to` contains a list of who may view this comment.
- `active` denotes if the given comment is still viewable

Next we will Create a Document with the schema above.

```json
{
  "from": "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dpc",
  "payload": "First!",
  "timestamp": 1662057089,
  "to": [
    "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dpd",
    "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dpd"
  ],
  "active": true
}
```

### Storing Documents

When an document is stored, it will be given its Identifier (`cid`) and stored within Sonr's distributed content storage network. After a successful upload the `cid` will be return along with the uploaded content.

### Storage/Referencing

It should be noted that once a Document is stored. The `cid` must be associated with a [bucket](/docs/intro/modules/buckets.mdx) to be retrievable. Buckets allow documents to be searched upon by schema, and meta-data. Currently (9/1/2022), only searching by a schema is supported, but indexing of buckets is expected soon.

## Usage

- See [Bucket](/docs/intro/modules/buckets.mdx) for more information on how documents can be related to other documents.
- See [Speedway](/docs/tools/speedway/cli.mdx) documentation on usage of documents through our management tooling.
- See [Motor-SDK](/docs/guides/data/documents.mdx) documentation in our SDK targets.
- Read [ADR-2](https://github.com/sonr-io/sonr/blob/dev/docs/architecture/2.md) for a more in depth technical explanation of the design decisions made for the Schema module.
