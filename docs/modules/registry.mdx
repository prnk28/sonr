The Sonr registry module is used to store the records of user accounts and applications. Each record contains a [DIDDocument](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) which allows users to leverage the power of the DID specification in order to create verifiable and unique users on the Sonr network.

## Overview

The record type utilized in the **Registry module** is the `WhoIs` type. We manage user's `DID Documents` in this `WhoIs` document which allows for your `Wallet Address` to be associated with the user's Document. This creates a powerful relationship where credentials and services can be tied to an entity which also handles your `Wallet Adredss`. Below is an example of a `WhoIs` document

## Registry and the Vault

When a new `WhoIs` is created on the sonr network, we first create `shards` of keys which will be used to verify the user against a `secret` which will decrypt your shards and verify against a publicly shared key. these shards are kept in a remote store and are created when you first create an account. Once these shards are created the passphrase must be provided to decrypt, and verify that the shards belong to your `WhoIs` an endpoint for retrieving `shards` are stored within the `DID Document` as a `Service endpoint` (see did specification for more info).

## Aliases

Soon, Aliases for `Domains` will be supported, allowing users to associate their `DID` with a domain name.

## Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Usage:

A library to parse and generate W3C [DID Documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and W3C [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

### New DID Document

```go
didID, err := did.ParseDID("did:snr:123")

// Empty did document:
doc := &did.Document{
    Context:            []did.URI{did.DIDContextV1URI()},
    ID:                 *didID,
}

// Add an assertionMethod
keyID, _ =: did.ParseDIDURL("did:snr:123#key-1")

keyPair, err := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
verificationMethod, err := did.NewVerificationMethod(*keyID, did.JsonWebKey2020, did.DID{}, keyPair.Public())

// This adds the method to the VerificationMethod list and stores a reference to the assertion list
doc.AddAssertionMethod(verificationMethod)

didJson, _ := json.MarshalIndent(doc, "", "  ")
fmt.Println(string(didJson))

// Unmarshal of a json did document:
parsedDIDDoc := did.Document{}
err = json.Unmarshal(didJson, &parsedDIDDoc)

// It can return the key in the convenient lestrrat-go/jwx JWK
parsedDIDDoc.AssertionMethod[0].JWK()

// Or return a native crypto.PublicKey
parsedDIDDoc.AssertionMethod[0].PublicKey()

```

Outputs:

```json
{
  "assertionMethod": ["did:snr:123#key-1"],
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "controller": "did:snr:123",
  "id": "did:snr:123",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "controller": "did:snr:123",
      "id": "did:snr:123#key-1",
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "crv": "P-256",
        "kty": "EC",
        "x": "UANQ8pgvJT33JbrnwMiu1L1JCGQFOEm1ThaNAJcFrWA=",
        "y": "UWm6q5n1iXyeCJLMGDInN40bkkKr8KkoTWDqJBZQXRo="
      },
      "type": "JsonWebKey2020"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

The registry module and `DIDDocument`'s are well integrated in the current Sonr [Motor SDK](/docs/guides/setup.mdx) implementations.

- See [Speedway](/docs/tools/speedway/cli.mdx) documentation on usage of DIDs through our management tooling.
- See [Motor-SDK](/docs/guides/auth/register.mdx) documentation in our SDK targets.
- Read [ADR-1](https://github.com/sonr-io/sonr/blob/dev/docs/architecture/1.md) for a more in depth technical explanation of the design decisions made for the registry module.
