### Motor Nodes and Highway Nodes

The Sonr network is collectively made up of motor nodes and highway nodes. Motor nodes act as clients and represent end-users, while highway nodes are the Sonr networkâ€™s servers for data transmission.

### Verifiable User Identity

Our base DID (or decentralized identifier) follows a syntactic structure of the **root** (your DID), followed by a **method** (or in our case sonr), then followed by a **public key**. For more information regarding the Sonr registry module [read here](/docs/intro/modules/registry.mdx).

### Handshake Network (HNS)

Sonr leverages Handshake Network (HNS), making Sonr aliases (i.e: sarah.snr/) universally resolvable as top-level domains across the Sonr Network.

### Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC)

IBC can be implemented by any consensus algorithm that supports cheaply verifiable finality with any state machine that supports vector commitments. IBC defines a set of low-level primitives for authentication, transport, and ordering, and a set of application-level standards for asset & data semantics. Ledgers which support compatible standards can be connected together without any special permissions.

### Realtime Peer to Peer Network

Our network is built upon `LibP2P`, a peer to peer communication protocol. This allows Highway Nodes and Motor nodes to transmit data, share files, and locate one another. Each motor node in our network is assigned a `DHT` address which allows for unique addressing of each motor in our application network.

### Sonr blockchain

A decentralized, permissionless, and open-source blockchain that is built on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/). It is a highly scalable and secure blockchain that is designed to be interoperable over the overall IBC network.
Within the Sonr ecosystem, the blockchain by design is a _**persistent pointer record store**_. This means that every piece of data , _excluding DID Documents_, is stored off-chain and cryptographically authorized using a resolver.
