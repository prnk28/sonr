## Why Sonr?

Sonr's decentralized, realtime network provides Web3 developers with a tool-set that to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications, with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

- **Developer Experience** -- We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, as our libraries are built on open standards.
- **Composable by Design** -- Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols. These protocols are extendable and support merging, which allows for reusability and composability.

## Something missing?

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [submit a request (Canny)](https://sonr.fyi/docs-requests) for us on our feature requests board. This allows us to appropriately triage issues, track demand across users, and aligns requested changes with our roadmap - which is also featured on Canny. If you'd like to make a PR (especially a large one), please talk to the Sonr team first to make sure we aren't already working on it!
