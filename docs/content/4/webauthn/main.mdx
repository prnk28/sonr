The Sonr Webauthn API allows users to authenticate themselves using their DID document and a Webauthn credential. When a user attempts to authenticate, the API checks their DID document to verify that they have a valid Webauthn credential registered. If the credential is valid, the user is prompted to authenticate using their Webauthn device (such as a security key or biometric authentication). Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to the requested resource. This process ensures that only users with a valid DID document and Webauthn credential can authenticate, providing a secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism.
