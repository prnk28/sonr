**Welcome** to the **Sonr developer community!** We're excited to have you join us in **building applications** that incorporate **decentralized identity and asset management**. Sonr leverages <Tooltip tip="DID documents are a decentralized, self-sovereign method of storing and sharing identity information.">DID Documents</Tooltip>, <Tooltip tip="DID documents are a decentralized, self-sovereign method of storing and sharing identity information.">WebAuthn</Tooltip>, and <Tooltip tip="DID documents are a decentralized, self-sovereign method of storing and sharing identity information.">IPFS</Tooltip> to provide users with a secure, user-friendly way to manage their digital
identity and assets.

With Sonr, developers can easily integrate decentralized identity and asset management into their applications, providing users with a seamless, secure experience. Whether you're building a decentralized application, a social network, or a
financial platform, Sonr has the tools you need to build a secure, user-friendly application that puts users in control of their own data and assets.

In this documentation, you'll find everything you need to get started building on Sonr. Let's dive in!
