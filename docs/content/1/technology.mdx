## Identity

Our base DID (or decentralized identifier) follows a syntactic structure of the **root** (your DID), followed by a **method** (or in our case sonr), then followed by a **public key**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DID Documents">
DID Documents are a key component of the decentralized identity (DID) ecosystem. DID Documents are used to represent the identity of a subject (such as a person or organization) on a decentralized ledger, such as a blockchain. A DID Document contains information about the subject, such as their public keys, authentication methods, and other relevant data. DID Documents are stored on a decentralized ledger and can be accessed and updated by the subject or their authorized agents.

DID Documents are designed to provide a secure, decentralized, and interoperable way to manage digital identities. They are a key building block of the decentralized identity ecosystem, which is being developed to provide individuals and organizations with control over their own digital identities and data. DID Documents are intended to enable a wide range of applications and use cases, from enabling secure online authentication to enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to interact with digital identities in a secure and interoperable way.

Overall, DID Documents are an important part of the emerging decentralized identity ecosystem and have the potential to revolutionize the way we manage and use digital identities.

  <Accordion title="Verifiable Credentials">
Verifiable credentials are digital documents that contain verifiable information about an individual or organization. They are designed to be secure, decentralized, and interoperable, and can be used to represent a wide range of information, such as educational qualifications, professional licenses, or membership in a particular organization.

Verifiable credentials are an important part of the decentralized identity ecosystem because they provide a secure and decentralized way to manage and share information about an individual or organization's identity. Because verifiable credentials are stored on a decentralized ledger, such as a blockchain, they can be accessed and verified by anyone with the appropriate permissions. This allows individuals and organizations to control their own digital identities and data, and to share it with others as needed.

Overall, verifiable credentials are digital documents that contain verifiable information about an individual or organization, and that can be used to represent a wide range of identity-related information in a secure and decentralized way.

    title="WebAuthentication (WebAuthn)"
>

<Note>
  The `WebAuthnAuthentication2018` type is a specific implementation of the
  WebAuthn standard that is used in DID Documents. It includes information about
  the authentication method used, such as the challenge, domain, and
  verification method, as well as the time at which the authentication was
  performed. This information can be used to verify the authenticity of the
  subject's identity and the authenticity of the DID Document.
</Note>

WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a standard for secure and scalable online authentication that can be used with DID Documents. WebAuthn is designed to provide a secure, interoperable, and user-friendly way to authenticate users online. It allows users to authenticate to online services using a variety of different authentication methods, such as biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) or hardware tokens (such as a security key).

WebAuthn is designed to be compatible with DID Documents and can be used to authenticate users using their decentralized identities. By using WebAuthn and DID Documents together, online services can provide users with a secure and decentralized way to authenticate themselves and access their data. This can help to improve the security and privacy of online authentication, while also making it easier for users to manage and control their digital identities.

Overall, WebAuthn and DID Documents are complementary technologies that can be used together to provide secure and decentralized online authentication.
