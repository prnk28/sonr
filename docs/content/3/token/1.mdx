**Sonr is a self-sovereign data platform** that enables developers to build user-centric, and privacy preserving applications - all secured by a Cosmos powered Blockchain. This document serves as our analysis on our recommended strategy for Token design.

## Fundamental Utility

The price of a token is the exchange rate of the token for fiat. The value of the token can be modeled in terms of fundamental demand drivers and effective supply. The demand of the token is driven by the property rights granted by the token, and the effective supply is driven by the number of tokens to which a specific set of rights are granted.
